# Chat log 2026-01-24

## Summary
- Refined the stats page layout, chart axes, and labels (month ticks, y-axis labels, subtitle width, and chart captions).
- Added new stats cards: protest activity mix, child-related coverage, U.S. citizenship/legal status mentions, red/blue state coverage, and top states by coverage.
- Added child and U.S. status badges in headlines and general coverage; updated detection to avoid false positives.
- Centralized child/U.S. status pattern matching in `frontend/src/mentionPatterns.ts` to reduce duplication.
- Expanded U.S. status matching to include naturalization and birthright-related phrases.
- Adjusted UI strings (titles, badges, subtitles) for clarity.

## Notes
- U.S. status mentions are detected client-side from `what/title/who` using regex patterns; no ingest-time flags are stored.
- Weekly ratios zero out weeks with fewer than 5 total articles to avoid tiny-sample spikes.
